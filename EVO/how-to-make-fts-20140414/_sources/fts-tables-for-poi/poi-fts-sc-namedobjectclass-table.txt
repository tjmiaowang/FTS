poiFtsSCNamedObjectClassTable
=============================

The table contains the named object classes assigned to the selection criteria.

   Need to talk with NavInfo, Zenrin and NDS consortium how to express
   its structure in a metadata table properly. There are a lot of vague things
   to fullfill these metadata tables.

   For good or bad, currently, our application does not see these
   metadata tables. They behaves on a document description, and tightly
   depends on current database storing condition. Thus, there is
   possibility, if we change structures slightly, it might affect
   their behaviors drastically. To remove such tight dependancy
   between database and application, we should maintain metadata
   tables correctly at first, then the application needs to utilize
   metadata so that it can behave flexibly.

Japan
=====

To express Japnese address structure, the following six levels are
needed, at least.

* Prefecture (都道府県)
* Municipality (市区町村)
* Machi / Oaza (町 / 大字)
* Chome / Aza (丁目 / 字)
* City block (街区) / Land number (番地)
* Houser number (住居番号) / Land number extension (支番)

.. note::

   Japanese addressing system:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system

But, currently, NDS specification does not have appropriate selection
criterions to which these Japanese address level can be mapped.

We need to talk with NDS consortium how to model Japanese address
structure in NDS.
