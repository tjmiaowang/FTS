buildingBlockId:
   Is a unique identification of an instance of a Building Block type
   within a update region. There can be multiple BuildingBlock
   instances of the same type, e.g. for the type "POI".
   
buildingBlockName:
    Building Block Name is a human readable name of a Building Block
    instance and is assigned by the ndsDbSupplier. It can be used by
    the system to display status information via HMI. This string is
    optional and hence can also be null.
    
buildingBlockType:
    Uniquely defines the type of a BuildingBlock. It is defined by the
    NDS standard.
    
buildingBlockDetailedType:
    Defines one out of several types which are possible for a building
    block type, e.g. different phonetic alphabet formats for phonetic
    transcriptions. As not all building blocks have a detailed type,
    this field can also be null.
